Side LEDE Project
=============================================

Personal overlay of things that I add(ed) on top of the LEDE/OpenWrt project.

That way I can just add my stuff at the rate I want, and not hold it
on my computer waiting for a power outage to fry my computer.

Basic mode of operation:
* keep a set of small build rules that just patch copy stuff over LEDE/OpenWrt
* clone official LEDE/OpenWrt repos and patch/extend them
* I care about a few targets [for various reasons] ; hold only these here
